#### Author: [Hamza Khalid](https://github.com/hmzakhalid)

    ANN and CNN are two different types of Neural Networks. ANN is a type of Neural Network that is used to solve classification and regression problems. CNN is a type of Neural Network that is used to solve image classification problems.

# Analysis 

 . | Artificial Neural Network | Convolutional Neural Network
---|---|----
Accuracy | 0.466 | 0.688


# Efficiency 

    CNN is more efficient than ANN in terms of accuracy and time taken to train the model.

# Simplicity 

    Although ANN is Simple to implement, An ANN treats the whole image as a single entity and CNN treats the image as a collection of small entities.
